Open a text editor or IDE such as PyCharm or Komodo.  Start typing in 
the code.

Run it. 

Repeat five times, starting with a blank screen.

Young children at age 9 should do one drill, writing the code in
one time per class.

Older students can run a few drills in each class.

This is designed for one on one teaching between a parent
and child.
